- [ ] Verify domain DNS points to Cloudflare

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Deployment
- [ ] Open PowerShell as Administrator
- [ ] Navigate to `C:\n8n-production`
- [ ] Set execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- [ ] Run deployment: `.\deploy.ps1`
- [ ] Verify services are running: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] Test local access: http://localhost:5678
- [ ] Test public access: https://n8n.improvemyrankings.com

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Service Installation (Optional)
- [ ] Run PowerShell as Administrator
- [ ] Execute: `.\install-service.ps1`
- [ ] Verify service: `Get-Service -Name "n8n-production"`
- [ ] Test service start/stop functionality
