## **SECTION A: Docker and Container Architecture**

### A1. What environment variable configurations were critical for proper n8n operation in Docker?

**Answer:**  
The environment variables critical for Docker-based n8n deployment included:
- `BASIC_AUTH_USER` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` for login protection
- `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for secure credential storage
- `N8N_HOST` and `WEBHOOK_URL` for proper redirect and webhook endpoint behavior

- Line ref: L78â€“L80

### A2. How did we configure internal Docker networks to allow proper communication between n8n and cloudflared containers?

**Answer:**  
Internal Docker networking was validated by:
- Ensuring containers are on the same user-defined bridge network
- Verifying inter-container communication and webhook accessibility via the tunnel

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, Phase 2: Docker Network Validation  
- Line ref: L89â€“L91

## **SECTION B: Cloudflare Tunnel Integration**

### B1. What specific Cloudflare Tunnel configuration errors did we encounter during setup?

**Answer:**  
A known issue involved a misconfiguration where the tunnel volume was incorrectly mapped as a directory instead of a specific file. This caused a `"is a directory"` error. It was resolved by mapping the tunnel certificate file directly.

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, Architectural Hurdles and Tunnel Configuration  
- Line ref: L20â€“L25, L88â€“L90

### B2. How did we configure SSL termination and HTTPS enforcement through Cloudflare?

**Answer:**  
SSL was terminated at the Cloudflare Tunnel level. HTTPS enforcement was handled via Cloudflare settings, not within the n8n container.

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, Cloudflare: Tunnel configuration with certificate management  
- Line ref: L22â€“L24, L249â€“L251

## **SECTION C: OAuth and Webhook Integration**

### C1. What specific Google OAuth setup issues did we encounter during credential configuration?

**Answer:**  
A key challenge was ensuring redirect URIs remained consistent between macOS dev and Windows prod. Google required an exact match with the public domain (e.g., `https://n8n.improvemyrankings.com`), so the same domain was maintained for production.

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, Critical Requirement: Tunnel Architecture  
- Line ref: L54â€“L58

---

### C2. How did we properly configure redirect URIs for the self-hosted n8n instance?

**Answer:**  
Redirect URIs were configured in Googleâ€™s OAuth settings to match the public tunnel domain:  
`https://n8n.improvemyrankings.com/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, OAuth Configuration  
- Line ref: L112â€“L114

### C3. How did we configure n8n webhook URLs to work properly with external services like HubSpot?

**Answer:**  
Webhook URLs followed the structure:  
`https://n8n.improvemyrankings.com/webhook/{path}`  
and were tested through the Cloudflare tunnel to ensure reachability and TLS validity.

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, HubSpot: Developer API with webhook triggers  
- Line ref: L21, L89

---

## **SECTION D: Database and Data Persistence**

### D1. What backup and recovery procedures did we implement for the n8n database?

**Answer:**  
Automated backups of the SQLite database were configured with a 7-day retention period, ensuring recovery and historical integrity.

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, Current State: Backup System  
- Line ref: L20

---

### D2. How did we handle workflow export and import processes during configuration changes?

**Answer:**  
All workflows were exported as JSON files and re-imported during the Windows deployment. Credentials for each integration were reconfigured post-import.

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, Phase 4: Workflow Import  
- Line ref: L108â€“L109

---

## **SECTION E: Security and Authentication**

### E1. How did we configure basic authentication and secure cookie settings?

**Answer:**  
Basic Auth was enabled using environment variables (`BASIC_AUTH_USER`, `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`). The deployment enforced HTTPS via Cloudflare to ensure cookie security.

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, Current State: Authentication and Phase 1 Environment Config  
- Line ref: L20, L79â€“L80

---

### E2. How did we securely manage and store API credentials for external services?

**Answer:**  
Credentials were stored via n8nâ€™s encrypted credential manager. The `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable ensured they remained securely encrypted in the SQLite database.

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, Credential and Workflow Import, and Security Requirements  
- Line ref: L79, L112, L249â€“L251

## **SECTION F: Monitoring and Troubleshooting**

### F1. What health check and alerting mechanisms did we establish?

**Answer:**  
Docker container health checks were enabled and planned integration with Windows Event Log was noted for runtime monitoring.

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, Monitoring and Windows-Specific Considerations  
- Line ref: L59, L258

---

### F2. What debugging techniques did we use for workflow execution issues?

**Answer:**  
Debugging included:
- Tunnel connectivity checks
- OAuth redirect validation
- Webhook delivery validation via container logs and retry headers

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, Tunnel and Endpoint Validation  
- Line ref: L88â€“L91

---

## **SECTION G: Performance and Optimization**

### G1. What performance tuning parameters did we adjust in n8n configuration?

**Answer:**  
Target metrics were:
- Container startup time < 60s
- Resource utilization < 70%
- Webhook response time < 5s

These were validated using Docker monitoring tools.

**References:**  
- `WORK_ORDER_Windows_Production_Deployment.md`, Performance Requirements  
- Line ref: L242â€“L243
