## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This work order documents the deployment of our fully functional n8n workflow automation platform from the current macOS development environment to a Windows Server production environment. The development system is currently operational with Docker, Cloudflare Tunnel, and integrated workflows for HubSpot, AWS SES, and Google OAuth. The production deployment will replicate this architecture on Windows Server while maintaining all functionality, security, and external integrations.

## üéØ TARGET DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE

### **Windows Server Production Environment**
- **Platform**: Windows Server 2019/2022 with Docker Desktop
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose (same as development)
- **Service Integration**: Windows Service for auto-startup
