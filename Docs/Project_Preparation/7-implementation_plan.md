# Implementation Plan for n8n Self-Hosting Project

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Mac Development Setup (1-2 hours)
**Objective**: Get n8n running locally with working HubSpot integration

#### Tasks
- [ ] Install ngrok via Homebrew
- [ ] Create Docker Compose configuration
- [ ] Start n8n container with SQLite database
- [ ] Configure ngrok tunnel for HTTPS access
- [ ] Import HubSpot workflow from cloud instance
- [ ] Update HubSpot OAuth redirect URI to ngrok URL
- [ ] Test workflow execution with property change

#### Success Criteria
- n8n accessible via ngrok HTTPS URL
- HubSpot webhook successfully triggers workflow
- Email notification delivered for test property change

### Phase 2: Enhanced Workflow Development (1 hour)
**Objective**: Add dynamic content and Gmail competitor monitoring

#### Tasks
- [ ] Enhance HubSpot workflow with dynamic SES emails
- [ ] Configure Amazon SES integration
- [ ] Create Gmail trigger for competitor monitoring
- [ ] Set up AI analysis node (OpenAI/Claude)
- [ ] Configure Google Drive file upload
- [ ] Test end-to-end Gmail workflow

#### Success Criteria
- Dynamic email content populated from HubSpot data
- Gmail monitoring workflow processes test emails
- AI summaries uploaded to Google Drive successfully

### Phase 3: Production Migration (1 hour)
**Objective**: Deploy to Windows tower with proper domain

#### Tasks
- [ ] Export n8n configuration from Mac
- [ ] Set up Docker on Windows tower
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Set up Traefik for SSL automation
- [ ] Update DNS A record for `n8n.lastapple.com`
- [ ] Update all OAuth redirect URIs to production domain
- [ ] Test all workflows in production environment

#### Success Criteria
- n8n accessible at `https://n8n.lastapple.com`
- All workflows functioning with production credentials
- SSL certificate automatically provisioned and valid

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### OAuth/URI Configuration Issues
- **Risk**: Webhook callbacks fail due to incorrect URLs
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Test thoroughly with ngrok before production
  - Keep detailed documentation of URI patterns
  - Have cloud instance as fallback during migration

#### SSL Certificate Problems
- **Risk**: Let's Encrypt fails or DNS propagation issues
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use ngrok as temporary solution during DNS setup
  - Test DNS configuration before certificate request
  - Manual certificate backup and restoration procedures

#### Performance Issues
- **Risk**: Hardware insufficient for workflow demands
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Monitor resource usage during testing
  - Optimize workflows for efficiency
  - Cloud hosting fallback if performance inadequate

### Business Risks

#### Service Interruption
- **Risk**: Workflows stop during migration causing missed leads
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**:
  - Maintain cloud instance during testing phase
  - Migrate during low-activity periods
  - Immediate rollback plan to cloud if issues

#### Data Loss
- **Risk**: Loss of workflow configurations or execution history
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**:
  - Export all workflows before migration
  - Regular automated backups
  - Version control for all configurations

### External Dependencies

#### Internet Connectivity
- **Risk**: ISP outage affecting webhook accessibility
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**:
  - Mobile hotspot backup for critical periods
  - Monitoring alerts for connectivity issues
  - Cloud fallback for extended outages

#### Third-party Service Changes
- **Risk**: API changes breaking integrations
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Subscribe to service API change notifications
  - Test integrations regularly
  - Maintain alternative integration options

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing
- Individual node configuration and data flow
- OAuth authentication for each service
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

#### Integration Testing
- End-to-end workflow execution
- Cross-service data consistency
- Performance under expected load

#### User Acceptance Testing
- Business stakeholder validation of outputs
- Email content and formatting review
- Timing and frequency confirmation

### Rollback Procedures

#### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
1. Reactivate cloud n8n instance
2. Update DNS to point back to cloud (if changed)
3. Verify cloud workflows functioning

#### Partial Rollback (Individual Workflows)
1. Disable problematic workflow in self-hosted instance
2. Reactivate equivalent workflow in cloud
3. Investigate and fix self-hosted issues
4. Re-migrate when stable

#### Complete Project Rollback
1. Export any new workflows for future use
2. Return to cloud instance exclusively
3. Cancel self-hosting infrastructure
4. Document lessons learned for future attempts

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Uptime**: > 99% availability
- **Response Time**: < 5 seconds for workflow execution
- **Error Rate**: < 1% failed executions
- **SSL Score**: A+ rating on SSL Labs

### Business Metrics
- **Cost Savings**: $300-600 annually vs cloud hosting
- **Feature Enhancement**: New workflows not possible in cloud
- **Response Time**: Faster email delivery for lead follow-up
- **Data Control**: Complete ownership of automation data

## Post-Implementation

### Monitoring Setup
- Daily execution summary emails
- Weekly performance reports
- Monthly cost analysis
- Quarterly security audit

### Maintenance Schedule
- **Daily**: Automated backups and health checks
- **Weekly**: Performance optimization review
- **Monthly**: Security updates and patches
- **Quarterly**: Full system backup and disaster recovery test

### Documentation Updates
- Maintain current network diagrams
- Update credential management procedures
- Document any custom configurations
- Keep troubleshooting guides current
