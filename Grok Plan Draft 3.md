Updated DART Setup for "Crows Nest"
Dartboard Name: "Crows-Nest-Intel" (create under General or n8n/Tasks; use hyphens for slug-friendliness).
Global Tags: [crows-nest, intel, monitoring, ai] – apply to all tasks/docs for easy querying.
Custom Properties: Add "Crows-Nest-Metric" (e.g., "Insights: 5") and "Phase" (1-4) to tasks.
Kickoff Task: "[2025-07-16] Crows-Nest-Launch – Name Integration & Phase 1" (Status: Doing, Priority: High, Due: 2025-07-17, Description: "Formalize name; update n8n prompt/workflow").
Scheduling: Use DART reminders for due dates; integrate n8n cron for auto-task creation (e.g., weekly trend reports spawn DART items via webhook).
Copy the tables below into DART task descriptions for structure. I'll use MCP-like calls in n8n for DART interactions (e.g., create_task on intel triggers).

Phase 1: Immediate Workflow Enhancement – "Crows Nest Core" (Today – July 17, 2025)

Rename your n8n workflow to "Crows-Nest-Spy"; enhance for named outputs.


Milestone Task	Description	Due Date	Dependencies	Metrics
Name Integration	Update n8n workflow name to "Crows-Nest-Spy". Add "Crows Nest" branding to reports (e.g., YAML tag: crows-nest). Test on Forte Labs email.	2025-07-16	n8n access	Reports include name; YAML tags searchable in Obsidian.
Prompt Confirmation	Lock in hybrid prompt (as demoed); verify YAML/Obsidian/Drive flow.	2025-07-16	Name Integration	100% reports with crows-nest YAML; before/after impact logged (e.g., +60% actionables).
DART Setup	Create "Crows-Nest-Intel" dartboard; add this phase's tasks. Link Drive folder ID to prompt.	2025-07-17	Prompt	Dartboard live; 5 tasks created with crows-nest tags.
Phase 2: Extraction & Vector Storage – "Crows Nest Vault" (July 18-22, 2025)

Build the "vault" for trends, named after your 3ch0-inspired archiving.


Milestone Task	Description	Due Date	Dependencies	Metrics
Extraction Enhancements	Code node: Parse AI summary for vectors (e.g., embed keywords via OpenAI). Tag with "crows-nest-vault".	2025-07-19	Phase 1	Entities extracted from 10 reports.
Vector DB Integration	Setup Pinecone index "crows-nest-vectors"; upsert with metadata.	2025-07-20	Extraction	DB queries return trends (e.g., "cohort demand evolution").
Trend Cron	n8n cron: Query for boiling points; auto-create DART task if threshold hit.	2025-07-22	DB	First "Crows Nest Trend Report" in Drive.
Phase 3: Actions & Alerts – "Crows Nest Signals" (July 23-29, 2025)

Automate "signals" like alerts/forwards/tasks.


Milestone Task	Description	Due Date	Dependencies	Metrics
Signal Logic	IF nodes: e.g., high-confidence pricing signal → forward email + alert.	2025-07-25	Phase 2	5 test signals actioned.
Alert Channels	Slack/Email: "Crows Nest Alert: Boiling point on AI cohorts – chime in."	2025-07-26	Logic	Alerts sent on thresholds.
Task Automation	DART webhook: Spawn tasks (e.g., "[Crows-Nest] Review Pricing Signal").	2025-07-29	Alerts	80% intel auto-tasked.
Phase 4: Channel Expansion & Scaling – "Crows Nest Horizon" (July 30-Onward)

Scan the "horizon" with social/outreach/content.


Milestone Task	Description	Due Date	Dependencies	Metrics
Social Integration	X/Reddit nodes: Search "AI cohort OR n8n alternative"; feed to vectors.	2025-08-05	Phase 3	50+ posts analyzed/week.
Outreach Automation	LinkedIn/Gmail: Auto-draft/send on opportunities (e.g., forum queries).	2025-08-10	Social	15 outreaches/month tracked in DART.
Content Generation	OpenAI chain: Create "Crows Nest Insights" posts/blogs from trends.	2025-08-15	Outreach	5 pieces/month; engagement KPIs in DART.
ScraperSky Link	Webhook: Trigger ScraperSky on email URLs (e.g., workshop pages).	Ongoing	Content	100+ scraped intel/month.
Monthly Iteration	DART review: Add channels (e.g., LinkedIn); refine based on metrics.	Monthly	All	System ROI: e.g., 10% client leads from intel.
Rollout Execution
Today: Phase 1 in n8n/DART. I'll simulate MCP: Create dartboard/tasks manually or via code if needed.
Monitoring: Weekly DART "[Crows-Nest] Review" task – log impact (e.g., "New prompt yielded 3 pricing signals → adjusted Tier 1 promo").
Endless Potential: As you said, endless—future phases could add AI personas for deeper analysis (e.g., "Intel Carver" sibling) or outreach bots. Budget: ~$5/month (APIs); scale via self-hosting.
Ready to knock this out—shall we start with DART creation details or a n8n export for the updated workflow?
