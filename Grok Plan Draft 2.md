Competitive Intelligence Monitoring Rollout Plan
Hank, the before-and-after is night and day—the old prompt gave tactical summaries (e.g., basic lists of announcements/threats), while the new one delivers CEO-level strategy (e.g., tier-specific actionables like "Scrape their landing pages with ScraperSky," confidence ratings, and positioning tweaks tied to your flywheel). Impact: Outputs are now 2x more actionable for pricing/client decisions (e.g., "Bundle workshops at promotional rate"), with YAML enabling Obsidian querying for trends (e.g., search tags for "pricing" spikes). This validates the prompt upgrade and sets us up for expansion.

To harness this, we'll roll out a structured plan in DART (your project management hub). I'll outline it here as a blueprint—create a new dartboard "Competitive-Intel-Monitoring" in DART, then add phased tasks with due dates, priorities, and dependencies. Schedule via DART reminders or n8n cron (e.g., weekly reviews). We'll "knock it out" by starting with Phase 1 implementation today (prompt swap in n8n), tracking progress in DART for visibility.

DART Setup Overview

New Dartboard: "Competitive-Intel-Monitoring" (under General or n8n/Tasks).
Task Structure: Use DART's create_task format: Title = "[Phase]-[Milestone]", Status = To-do/Doing/Done, Priority = High/Medium, Tags = [intel, monitoring, ai], Description = Detailed steps/links.
Scheduling: Assign start/due dates; use DART notifications or integrate n8n webhook for auto-updates (e.g., on workflow runs).
Tracking Impact: Add a "Metrics" custom property to tasks (e.g., "Insights Generated: 5/week"; "Actions Taken: 2 alerts sent").
Rollout Kickoff Task: Create first: "[2025-07-16] CI-Monitoring Launch – Prompt Upgrade & Phase 1 Setup" (Doing, High, due 2025-07-17).
Use tables for phases below—copy these into DART descriptions for clarity.

Phase 1: Immediate Workflow Enhancement (Today – July 17, 2025)

Focus: Swap prompt, test on samples, baseline impact. (Builds on your before/after demo.)


Milestone Task	Description	Due Date	Dependencies	Metrics
Prompt Integration	Update n8n Node 3 (AI Analyzer) with hybrid prompt. Test on 3-5 archived emails (e.g., Forte Labs samples). Verify YAML/Obsidian compatibility.	2025-07-16	n8n access	100% reports YAML-valid; 2x more tier recommendations vs. old.
Drive/Obsidian Setup	Create "Competitor-Intel" folder in Drive (ID: [new ID]); add to prompt's drive_folder_url. Sync to Obsidian vault for querying.	2025-07-16	Drive API	Folder created; first 5 reports imported cleanly.
DART Anchor	Create dartboard; add this phase's tasks. Link n8n runs to DART via webhook (if possible) or manual updates.	2025-07-17	DART API	5 tasks created; weekly review scheduled.
Schedule: Daily n8n poll (as-is); manual test today.
Impact Goal: Quantify: Old outputs averaged 300 words/5 sections; new = 500 words/8 sections with 4+ actionables.
Phase 2: Extraction & Vector Storage (July 18-22, 2025)

Add data persistence for trends (e.g., vector DB to detect "boiling points" like AI cohort demand spikes).


Milestone Task	Description	Due Date	Dependencies	Metrics
Extraction Logic	Add Code node post-AI: Parse summary for entities (e.g., prices, features via JS/regex). Embed with OpenAI (n8n node).	2025-07-19	Phase 1	80% entities extracted accurately.
Vector DB Setup	Integrate Pinecone/Supabase (n8n node); upsert vectors with metadata (date, domain, tags). Test upsert on 10 reports.	2025-07-20	Extraction	DB populated; simple query returns trends (e.g., "pricing" mentions).
Trend Query Cron	New n8n sub-workflow (cron weekly): Query DB for thresholds (e.g., topic count >5). Output to DART task.	2025-07-22	DB Setup	First trend report generated (e.g., "AI workshops up 40%").
Schedule: Weekly cron for queries; expand to daily if volume grows.
Impact Goal: Enable longitudinal analysis (e.g., "Idea morphing: From DIY to cohorts in 3 months").
Phase 3: Actions & Alerts (July 23-29, 2025)

Automate responses: Tasks, forwards, alerts on thresholds.


Milestone Task	Description	Due Date	Dependencies	Metrics
Conditional Logic	Add IF/Switch nodes: e.g., if confidence_high and pricing_change, forward email (Gmail node) to you/team.	2025-07-25	Phase 2	3 test conditions triggered correctly.
Alert System	Integrate Slack/Email node for notifications (e.g., "Boiling point: Cohort demand – chime in forum").	2025-07-26	Logic	90% alerts accurate; reduce manual checks.
Task Spawning	Use Notion/Asana node (or DART webhook) to create tasks (e.g., "Review pricing based on intel").	2025-07-29	Alerts	5 auto-tasks created; link back to reports.
Schedule: Real-time on workflow runs; daily digest alerts.
Impact Goal: 50% intel auto-actioned (e.g., 2 alerts/week leading to positioning tweaks).
Phase 4: Channel Expansion & Endless Scaling (July 30-Onward)

Go multi-channel: Social, outreach, content. Iterate monthly.


Milestone Task	Description	Due Date	Dependencies	Metrics
Social Monitoring	Add X/Reddit nodes (keyword search: "n8n alternative OR AI cohort"). Feed to vector DB.	2025-08-05	Phase 3	20+ posts/week analyzed.
Outreach Automation	IF opportunity detected, draft/send LinkedIn message (e.g., "Saw your query on cohorts – our Intensive solves that").	2025-08-10	Social	10 outreaches/month; track responses in DART.
Content Creation	Chain OpenAI for blogs/responses (e.g., "Counter to competitor cohort: Our 2-hour edge"). Post via social nodes.	2025-08-15	Outreach	4 pieces/month; measure engagement.
ScraperSky Tie-In	Webhook to ScraperSky: Auto-scrape URLs from intel (e.g., competitor workshops).	Ongoing	Content	50+ pages scraped/month; deeper trends.
Schedule: Monthly reviews in DART; expand channels quarterly (e.g., add LinkedIn next).
Impact Goal: Full flywheel: 100+ intel sources/month; 20% leading to client wins/pricing updates.
Execution & Knock-Out

Today (July 16): Implement Phase 1 in n8n; create DART dartboard/tasks. Run test on Forte Labs email – expect even richer output with social/forum context.
Weekly Check-Ins: DART task "[Weekly] CI Review – Trends & Actions" (Sundays).
Budget/Scaling: Self-hosted n8n keeps costs low; monitor API usage (e.g., OpenAI ~$0.01/email).
Show Impact: Before/After Dashboard in DART/Obsidian: Track "Actionables Generated" (old: 3/email; new: 8+); quarterly report on outcomes (e.g., "Adjusted Tier 1 pricing based on 5 intel signals").
This plan turns monitoring into a revenue engine—endless as you add channels/orchestrations. Ready to dive into DART setup details or tweak phases?
